# Release notes

Make Matplotlib windows feel like a real plotting workstation: keep window geometry stable across runs (macOS) and keep terminal-run scripts alive without blocking the GUI.

## Highlights

- Persist window position+size across runs on macOS: `track_position_size(fig, tag=...)` restores on startup and saves when you finish moving/resizing the window.
- Terminal-friendly `hold_windows()`: keep your script alive while the GUI stays responsive (AnyKey default; Enter also supported).
- Repo includes runnable demos + a tiny `examples/Makefile` so you can try everything quickly.

Quick demo:

```bash
make -f examples/Makefile geom-cache
```

## Notes

- Window geometry persistence is currently macOS-only (`macosx` backend). It relies on upstream Matplotlib macOS manager APIs from: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31172

## Breaking changes (rename)

- Project rename to better reflect scope:
  - distribution: `matplotlib-window-tracker`
  - import: `matplotlib_window_tracker`
- Install/import migration:
  - `pip install mpl-nonblock` -> `pip install matplotlib-window-tracker`
  - `import mpl_nonblock` -> `import matplotlib_window_tracker`
- Cache location/env var renamed:
  - `.mpl-nonblock/` -> `.matplotlib-window-tracker/`
  - `MPL_NONBLOCK_CACHE_DIR` -> `MATPLOTLIB_WINDOW_TRACKER_CACHE_DIR`
