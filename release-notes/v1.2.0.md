# Change log

## New features

- macOS window geometry persistence: `track_position_size(fig, tag=...)` restores a window's last position+size on startup and saves updates when you finish moving/resizing the window.
- `hold_windows()` now supports continuing with either any key (default) or Enter (`trigger="Enter"`).
- New runnable examples + `examples/Makefile` targets to quickly verify workflows (`make -f examples/Makefile help`).

## Bug fixes

- Improved TTY detection in `hold_windows()` to avoid blocking in non-interactive environments.

## Improvements under the hood

- Removed the old wrapper layer around Matplotlib show/refresh; the package now sticks to Matplotlib-native primitives (`plt.pause`, `plt.show`) and focuses on the features that Matplotlib doesn't provide.
- Split terminal key handling into a dedicated module and tightened tests around the new geometry cache.

## Breaking changes

- Removed wrapper APIs that redefined Matplotlib semantics (`show()`, `refresh()`, `ShowStatus`). Use Matplotlib directly (`plt.show`, `plt.pause`).
- Removed diagnostics CLI/entrypoint (`mpl-nonblock-diagnose`).

## Notes

- Window geometry persistence is currently macOS-only and requires Matplotlib macOS manager APIs from PR https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31172.
