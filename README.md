# mpl-nonblock

This package, `mpl-nonblock`, is designed for scientists and anyone who prefers a
script-based workflow (plain `.py` files) with IPython.

It solves two simple, practical annoyances that show up as soon as your code
produces more than one plot:

- keep your workflow nonblocking: show/update many figures in one run without
  having to repeatedly press Enter to continue
- keep windows where you placed them: reuse the same OS windows across re-runs, so
  you can refresh their contents instead of constantly chasing new windows around

Why a script-based workflow when you have Jupyter notebooks?

Notebooks are great for a first exploration. But once your work grows into a real
project (multiple files, refactors, repeated runs, version control), scripts tend
to scale better and stay easier to maintain.

This workflow is also agent-friendly: plain Python files are much easier to edit
and refactor (by you and by coding assistants) than a notebook that accumulates
hidden state over time.

One nice side-effect of this workflow: you can run a script that generates figures,
then keep working in the same IPython session (inspect results, tweak parameters,
generate more figures) while the generated figures stay visible. In contrast,
without `mpl-nonblock`, if you ran the same script from the terminal in a
noninteractive Python session, you would lose the ability to inspect the generated
figures after the program exited at the end.

For this to work you need a GUI backend (see [Choosing a Backend](#choosing-a-backend)).
On macOS, the `macosx` backend is built in and does not require extra installation.

## What You Get

- Stable window reuse (Matplotlib-native): use `plt.subplots(num=..., clear=...)` to
  keep reusing the same OS window (stable position) across runs in the same process.
- Terminal-run convenience `hold_windows()`: keep a script alive after creating
  figures while keeping the GUI responsive; exit when a key is pressed or when all
  figures are closed.
- Best-effort focus helper (optional): `raise_figure(fig)` attempts to bring a
  native figure window to the foreground on supported backends.

## Quickstart

This package is meant for running plotting code from scripts (files), and then
re-running those scripts smoothly while keeping multiple figure windows responsive.

1) Put your plotting code in a file, e.g. `your_script.py`:

```python
import time

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mpl_nonblock import is_interactive


def main() -> None:
    fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(num="A", clear=True)
    fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots(num="B", clear=True)

    for k in range(200):
        ax1.cla(); ax1.plot([0, 1], [0, k])
        ax2.cla(); ax2.plot([0, 1], [k, 0])

        # Matplotlib-native GUI tick (nonblocking).
        plt.pause(0.001)

        # A short pause if you need to reduce the
        # the number of frames per second
        time.sleep(0.02)

    # If you run this from a non-interactive Python
    # (i.e., not from IPython or any other interactive
    # Python sessions), keep windows open at the end
    # bt preventing exiting the code too immediately
    # after the last frame of the movie.
    if not is_interactive():
        # Terminal-run fallback: keep windows open after the script ends.
        # Minimal (may not work on every backend):
        #
        #   import sys
        #   if sys.stdin.isatty():
        #       input("Press Enter to exit...")
        #
        # Robust: keep the GUI responsive while waiting.
        from mpl_nonblock import hold_windows

        # Default: exit on any key (prints a default prompt).
        # If you prefer Enter, use: hold_windows(trigger="Enter")
        hold_windows()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2) In IPython, pick a backend for the session, then run the script:

```python
%matplotlib macosx  # macOS
%matplotlib tk      # Linux/Windows

%run -i your_script.py
```

For finer control over backend selection (including cross-platform `matplotlib.use(...)`)
see [Choosing a Backend](#choosing-a-backend).

## Matplotlib-Native Refresh

This project intentionally avoids wrapping `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`.

Use Matplotlib primitives directly:

- Per-frame GUI event processing: `plt.pause(dt)`
- Nonblocking show (global tick): `plt.show(block=False)`
- Blocking at end of script: `plt.show(block=True)`

When running from a terminal and you want to keep the process alive while the GUI stays
responsive, use `hold_windows()`.

## Choosing a Backend

Matplotlib needs a GUI "backend" (a windowing system bridge) to open interactive
plot windows and keep them responsive.

Reference: Matplotlib docs (https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/backends.html)

The simplest cross-platform pattern (works in IPython too) is to set the backend in the code
before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`:

```python
import matplotlib
from mpl_nonblock import recommended_backend

# `respect_existing=True` means "if something already selected a backend in this session
# (e.g. via `%matplotlib` / environment variable `MPLBACKEND`), keep using it".
matplotlib.use(recommended_backend(respect_existing=True), force=True)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Then run your code in IPython:

```python
%run -i your_code.py
```

Note the flag `-i` stands for interactive and allows you to share the same variable space
as your code. You may skip it if you mean to keep variable scope confined to your code.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can skip `matplotlib.use(...)` in your code and
avoid defining the backend. Instead, select a backend in IPython with the
`%matplotlib` magic:

- macOS: `%matplotlib macosx`
- Linux: `%matplotlib qt` (fallback: `%matplotlib tk`)

before running your code with:

```python
%run -i your_code.py
```

Hence, you can set the backend either in code (`matplotlib.use(...)`) or in IPython
(`%matplotlib ...`). If you use both and in conjunction with `recommended_backend()`, the
backend your code selects depends on what `recommended_backend()` returns.

By default (`respect_existing=True`), `recommended_backend()` returns an already-selected
backend (e.g. via `%matplotlib ...` / environment variable `MPLBACKEND`). Set
`respect_existing=False` to always return the platform recommendation defined by your script.

About `matplotlib.use(..., force=...)`:

- `force=True` (recommended) raises an error if the backend cannot be set up (either because
  it fails to import, or because an incompatible GUI interactive framework is already running).
- `force=False` silently ignores failures.

Thus, `force` does not mean "force a switch".

In plain terms: switching between different interactive GUI backends only works
before any GUI toolkit has started handling events. Once Matplotlib has already
opened a GUI window using one GUI toolkit (for example Tk), you cannot switch
mid-session to a different GUI toolkit (for example GTK or Qt). If you need a
different interactive backend, start a fresh Python/IPython session and select the
backend before creating any figures.

Practical note: avoid changing the GUI toolkit backend after importing
`matplotlib.pyplot`. At that point Matplotlib cannot switch to a different GUI toolkit.

If you need it in your workflow, you can still switch to non-interactive backends
such as `pdf` or `svg` to export figures to files. This will not affect opened figures.

You can then switch back to the originally selected GUI toolkit backend (e.g.
`TkAgg`), but not to a different GUI toolkit.

Alternatively, you can simply use `fig.savefig("plot.svg")`,
`fig.savefig("plot.pdf")`, etc. without changing the backend.

Recommended practice:

- In scripts, set the backend once, early, before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- In IPython, if you want to preselect a backend for the session, use `%matplotlib ...`
  and keep `recommended_backend(respect_existing=True)` in code.

## API Overview

Import name is `mpl_nonblock`:

 - `recommended_backend(macos="macosx", linux="TkAgg", windows="TkAgg", other="TkAgg", respect_existing=True)`
    - Returns a backend name recommendation for your platform.
    - If a backend already appears configured (e.g. `%matplotlib ...` / `MPLBACKEND`), it
      returns the current backend when `respect_existing=True`.
    - Does not call `matplotlib.use()`; backend selection stays explicit.

  - `raise_figure(fig)`
    - Best-effort: bring a native figure window to the foreground (backend-dependent).

 - `is_interactive()`
  - Returns `True` when running inside IPython/Jupyter or a REPL-ish session
    (checks for IPython, `sys.ps1`, and `sys.flags.interactive`).

   - `hold_windows(*, poll=0.05, prompt=..., trigger="AnyKey", only_if_tty=True)`
     - Terminal-run fallback: keep windows open after a script ends, while keeping the GUI responsive.
     - Returns when the user presses any key (or Enter with `trigger="Enter"`) or when all figure windows are closed.
     - If `prompt` is omitted, a default prompt is printed based on `trigger`. Use `prompt=None` to print nothing.

## Demos

Two tagged windows (sin/cos) from a source checkout:

```bash
python examples/two_windows.py
```

## Tests

Unit tests are headless-safe and do not open GUI windows.
They force the `Agg` backend so they can run in CI.

Install test dependencies, then run pytest.

From a source checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest
```

The `[test]` extra installs test-only dependencies (currently `pytest`).

If you installed from PyPI and want to run tests locally:

```bash
python -m pip install "mpl-nonblock[test]"
python -m pytest
```

If you are using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
python -m pytest
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing shows" in IPython

1) Verify you are using a GUI backend:
   - `%matplotlib macosx` (macOS)
   - `%matplotlib qt` / `%matplotlib tk` (Linux)

2) If you are headless (no GUI): there is no window to show.
Use `fig.savefig(...)`.

## Design Notes / Limitations

- Window position persistence comes from reusing the same native window
  (Matplotlib figure `num=`). This persists within a single Python process/kernel.
- This library does not attempt to persist window geometry across separate processes.
- Backend switching is only possible before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`.
- `hold_windows()` is meant for terminal-run scripts; it returns immediately when stdin
  is not a TTY (default `only_if_tty=True`).
- Bringing a window to the foreground is backend-dependent. Matplotlib does not expose
  a single portable API for this, so `raise_figure()` may be a no-op on some setups.
